        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p> However you spell or pronounce them, kebabs take pride of place in Persian cuisine. They are small pieces of seasoned whole or ground beef, lamb, or chicken 
            that are generally skewered and grilled. Mention “Ka-bob” (the Farsi pronunciation) to an Iranian, and deep and sentimental memories and associations are inevitably 
            evoked. Kebabs are prepared and served throughout the cities, whether at posh establishments, local food carts, or grand bazaars. The sights, sounds, and aromas 
            of kebabs being grilled are all so familiar, and kebab houses are often referenced as landmarks when giving directions.</p>
            <p>Perhaps one of the most important aspects of making Kabob Koobideh properly is the kneading technique. In fact, "Koobideh" is a Farsi word referencing the act of 
            pounding or smashing. This is where you must forget everything you have been told about making hamburgers, which is to not over-mix and compress the ground meat. 
            When it comes to Kabob Koobideh, the meat and other ingredients must be kneaded for up to 10 minutes to create a highly homogeneous and somewhat sticky paste that 
            properly sticks to the skewer and holds its shape while grilling.</p>
            <p>Kabob Koobideh is generally grilled with tomatoes, green peppers, onions, or other vegetables. The traditional grilling method is to suspend the kebabs directly 
            over hot glowing charcoals without a grill grate, to prevent the meat from sticking to the grate and falling off the skewers. Traditionally, Kabob Koobideh is 
            served with heaping amounts of steamed basmati rice. Butter and a single egg yolk are mixed right into the steaming hot rice to create a rich and creamy texture. 
            Finally, the rice is topped with tangy and brilliantly-colored sumac. This, along with pieces of flatbread, fresh herbs and raw onions, makes for a delicious 
            meal.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
             <ul>
              <li>2 onions, peeled</li>
              <li>cheesecloth</li>
              <li>1 pound ground lamb</li>
              <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
              <li>1 green onion, diced</li>
              <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon sumac powder</li>
              <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
              <li>2 eggs</li>
              <li>8 (10 inch) metal skewers</li>
             </ul>

             <h3>Steps</h3>
             <ol>
                <li>Shave onions with a grater into a fine mesh strainer. Gently press pulp into the strainer to remove juices. Place pulp into the center of the cheesecloth 
                    and gently press until no further juice drips out. </li>
                <li>Place lamb and beef in a pot. Add green onion and onion pulp; mix until thoroughly combined. Mix in baking powder, salt, pepper, sumac, and turmeric. 
                    Add eggs and mix thoroughly. Cover the pot and place in the refrigerator until flavors have melded, at least 30 minutes. </li>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. </li>
                <li>Mold meat mixture onto the skewers. </li>
                <li>Cook on the preheated grill, rotating every minute, until nicely browned on all sides, and meat is no longer pink in the center, about 25 minutes. </li>
             </ol>
