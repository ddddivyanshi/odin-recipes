        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> However you spell or pronounce them, kebabs take pride of place in Persian cuisine. They are small pieces of seasoned whole or ground beef, lamb, or chicken that 
            are generally skewered and grilled. Mention “Ka-bob” (the Farsi pronunciation) to an Iranian, and deep and sentimental memories and associations are inevitably 
            evoked. Kebabs are prepared and served throughout the cities, whether at posh establishments, local food carts, or grand bazaars. The sights, sounds, and aromas 
            of kebabs being grilled are all so familiar, and kebab houses are often referenced as landmarks when giving directions.</p>
        <p>Perhaps one of the most important aspects of making kabob koobideh properly is the kneading technique. In fact, "koobideh" is a Farsi word referencing the act of 
            pounding or smashing. This is where you must forget everything you have been told about making hamburgers, which is to not over-mix and compress the ground meat. 
            When it comes to kabob koobideh, the meat and other ingredients must be kneaded for up to 10 minutes to create a highly homogeneous and somewhat sticky paste that 
            properly sticks to the skewer and holds its shape while grilling. </p>
        <p>Kabob koobideh is generally grilled with tomatoes, green peppers, onions, or other vegetables. The traditional grilling method is to suspend the kebabs directly 
            over hot glowing charcoals without a grill grate, to prevent the meat from sticking to the grate and falling off the skewers. Traditionally, kabob koobideh is 
            served with heaping amounts of steamed basmati rice. Butter and a single egg yolk are mixed right into the steaming hot rice to create a rich and creamy texture. 
            Finally, the rice is topped with tangy and brilliantly-colored sumac. This, along with pieces of flatbread, fresh herbs and raw onions, makes for a delicious 
            meal. </p>
