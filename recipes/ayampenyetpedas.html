        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Ayam penyet is a common home cooked meal in Indonesia, but it is also sold as a street food. There are many aspects of ayam penyet that separate it from the 
                fried chicken that most people in the Western world know. Like much of the Indonesian food, it is incredibly spicy. But there is more to it than that.</p>
            <p>First of all, the chicken is cooked twice: first it is boiled in a mixture of herbs that includes ginger, galangal, lemongrass, and then it is deep fried. Before 
                it is cooked the chicken is also smashed until the pieces are flattened, similar to a “smash burger” here in the United States. In fact, penyet is the 
                Indonesian word for pressing an object. Sometimes the chicken is smashed with a mallet after it is been cooked; the point of this process is to loosen the meat 
                from the bones, making it easier to eat with your fingers.</p>
            <p>The signature feature of Indonesian fried chicken, however, is sambal. Once the chicken has been fried, it is topped with a layer of thick sambal(a chili paste 
                seasoned with lime juice, garlic, shrimp paste, and palm sugar, among other ingredients). If you are not used to spice, the sambal will probably be hard to 
                handle, but it is a key element to the dish. Luckily, it is not always served on top of the chicken, but as a condiment on the side, so you can choose how much 
                you want to try on your chicken.</p>
            <p>If you are lucky enough to pass by a street food stall making ayam penyet, you might see the cook preparing the sambal by cooking the chilies in oil, then 
                mashing the chilis together with the other ingredients in a huge pestle. When you buy it from a street food vendor, ayam penyet is usually served with a 
                mound of rice, fried tofu or tempeh, and sliced cucumber.</p>
            <p>Ayam penyet might have originated in Surabaya, in East Java relatively recently, at a restaurant chain that originally served a tempeh dish with sambal. When the 
                owner added fried chicken to the dish, it turned out to be a hit and the restaurant opened a chain that specializes in ayam penyet, and the dish cemented itself 
                in Indonesian cuisine. Today you can see small vendors and carts all over the country preparing the dish.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>5 cloves garlic, peeled, divided</li>
                <li>3 shallots, divided</li>
                <li>1 ½ inch piece fresh ginger root, peeled and chopped</li>

                <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
                <li>4 chicken thighs</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups water</li>
                <li>2 salam leaves (substitute with curry leaves)</li>
                <li>3 teaspoons oil, divided, or as needed</li>

                <li>1 bunch lemon basil (kemangi)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine garlic, 1 shallot, ginger, galangal, coriander, and 1 1/2 teaspoon salt in a mortar and pestle; pound into a paste. </li>

                    to a mortar and pestle and add lime juice, shrimp paste, 1/2 teaspoon salt, sugar, and lemon basil. Pound everything into a paste. </li>
                <li>Place the sambal (chili sauce) at the bottom of a serving plate and place the chicken on top of the dish. </li>
