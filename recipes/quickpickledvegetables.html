        <h1>Spicy Vietnamese Quick-Pickled Vegetables</h1>
        <img src="images/quickpickledvegetables.jpeg" alt="A jar of pickled carrots, jalapenos, radish, and cucumbers">
        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These Vietnamese-style pickled vegetables are traditionally served as a condiment for banh mi sandwiches, but they make a nice side for anything you would 
                normally pair with coleslaw, like fish and chips, barbecued meats, fish tacos, etc. Store in the refrigerator for up to one month.</p>
            <p>Pickled carrots and daikon are a signature addition to Vietnamese dishes. Their bright brine adds a splash of colour to the deep spices and flavours of 
                Vietnamese proteins, while the crunch adds depth and texture to the otherwise soft or dry aspects of something like a banh mi sandwich.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups water</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups rice vinegar</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                <li>½ pound carrots, peeled and cut into matchsticks</li>
                <li>½ pound purple daikon radish, peeled and cut into matchsticks</li>
                <li>½ pound English cucumbers, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>2 medium jalapeno peppers, sliced into rings</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Inspect two pint-sized jars for cracks and rings for rust, discarding any defective ones. Immerse in simmering water until needed. Wash new, unused lids 
                    and rings in warm soapy water. </li>
                <li>Bring water, vinegar, sugar, and salt to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook until sugar dissolves, about 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and 
                    let it cool for 2 minutes. </li>
                <li>Meanwhile, divide carrots, radish, cucumbers, and jalapeños evenly between the two clean jars. Pour hot liquid over vegetables in the jars and let it come 
                    to room temperature, about 30 minutes. </li>
                <li>Screw on lids and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving. </li>
            </ol>
