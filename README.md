# odin-recipes

This project demonstrates my html and commit messages skills, notwithstanding its small scale. I was required to create three recipe webpages(with images) and provide a link to those webpages via index page.

Things that I was reminded of time and time again during the project:
atomic commit messages are necessary to give a shape(idea to the readers and even to you) about your ongoing project;
a structured file system helps more than I know or realize even now;
have faith that even I can do this project and others(from scratch) and, more importantly, finish those projects;
